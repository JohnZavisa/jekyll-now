title: Verge (XVG) and Tronix (TRX)

Verge and Tronix are two <1$ altcoins that have a lot of potential to grow. As of right now, XVG fluctuates between .11$ and .14$. 
I think XVG has potential,because it is one of the first coins that allow on-click anonymity, meaning you can choose when to hide a 
transaction. This is done with the newest rollout called Wraith Protocol by the Verge team. It hit .30$ in a past pump before the release,
and with the long awaited release of Wraith, 2018 should be an exciting year for Verge.

Tronix is really great, because it's a platform for entertainment and data storing/hosting. Users can freely publish, store and own data, 
and in the decentralized autonomous form. Right now, this coin is sitting around .08$. It's starting to gain some marketing steam, and the
crypto world is starting to discover it. This is a coin to keep an eye on.
