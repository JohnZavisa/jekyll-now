title: Alt-Coin 
---

I have lots of hope for alt-coin (any coin other than bc), and heres why:
I dont see there being a monopoly on digicurrency with it being platformed on a decentralized open source system; the big benefit of
digital currency is the variety of alternatives to standard currency. It's all basically peer to peer. 
Most altcoins are late bloomers and they are already on the heels of bitcoin, and the more popular BC becomes, the more value 
people will put into altcoin, ESPECIALLY with decentralized phone and computer apps.

In many years from now I think people will be talking about the days that BC, Ethereum, LiteCoin, etc, first became popularized and 
boomed, like gas station companies when people finally all had cars to use them, Dapps being the cars, and digicoins being the gas station 
companies. It's instant, encrypted p2p currency. That's gonna be enormous. I look forward to the future of cryptocurrency.
