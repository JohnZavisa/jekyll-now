Imagine an alien race that inhabits a “curved planet”, that is, a planet that exists in warped space. This alien race has an auditory 
cortex that organizes sound completely different than humans due to the shape of the curved planet. Be reminded: the planet itself is 
not what is curved, but rather the space-time that of which this planet is suspended in is curved, which might give the visual effect of 
standing inside a massive geo-tube. This alien race has a different visual cortex as well, bending and contorting shapes relative to the 
space-time bent shape of their planet. Perhaps this planet looks something like this.

This planet could still possess a core like ours, and operate based on the known physical laws of the universe, although being in a piece 
of warped space-time, the planet gives off a sort of multi-dimensional appearance. The gravity of the planet might be at an equilibrium
allowing you to walk on all sides of the inner tube. What might their music sound like to humans? What might it sound like to them? What 
might their bodies look like?
