title: My Mining Rig 
---

Below is a picture of my current cryptocurrency mining rig. I am running 6 AMD RX 570 GPUs with an Aurom 1200w PSU. It uses the operating
system EthOS, which is a Linux Distrobution. I prefer Linux based OS, as I have more experience with Linux/GNU administration. I'm using
a 4GB flash drive for storing everything, including the OS! I get away with this by having my OS automimously delete past
DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) files that have been stored or cached. It's a very efficient setup.

I'm acheiving anywhere between 150-160 MH/s for Ethereum, and between 2900-5200 MH/s for Decred, as I am dual-mining.
