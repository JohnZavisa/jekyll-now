title: An Answer to Net Neutrality
---



Don't lose all hope for the internet after losing net neutrality here in The States today. 
Computer Scientists all over the world (myself and my friends included) are working on ways to build a new 
infrastructure for the internet with mesh networking. This allows everyone to act as a node in the network that serves the 
web to eachother. We're looking at platforming this on the Ethereum Blockchain to create a market for telecommunication 
services that cut out ISPs as middle men completely, allowing a user controlled market, open source web once again. 
Blockchain based mesh networking will be able to answer the loss of equality on the web, it's just a matter of time and effort.
